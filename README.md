Webify
======

The aim of webify is to make it easy to convert a directory of Markdown files into a browsable website.  It's basically me hacking around at the moment, but the hope is to turn it into a well tested gem

TODO
----
- Include table of contents in each page, for easy navigation
- Package as a gem
- Support other filetypes (other than markdown)
